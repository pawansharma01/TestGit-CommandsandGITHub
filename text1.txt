GIT Cheat Sheet

 

init — Create an empty GIT repository in your development directory

    Go to directory
    git init

 

status — Show the current state of the repository including un-added and un-committed files

    git status

 

add — Add a file to the repository staging area

    Create a file, e.g. file.txt
    git add file.txt

Add all new or changed files to the repository staging area (the period means all)

    git add .

 

commit — Commit all changes to the repository for first time (-m means message)

    git commit –m “Initial commit”

Commit all changes to the repository for later activities

    git commit –m “Description of changes being made to project”

 

branch — Create a new branch of the project

    Choose a name for the new branch (original branch is master), e.g. test
    git branch test

List all branches (* appears next to current branch)

    git branch

 

checkout — Switch branches and check-out all files (e.g. to test branch)

    git checkout test

Create a new branch and check-out files in one command

    git checkout –b test

 

merge — Merge two branches together (go to the destination branch first, e.g. master)

    git checkout master
    git merge test

 

(delete) — Delete a branch that you no longer need (e.g. after a merge)

    git branch test –d

Or to force the delete:

    git branch test –D

 

log — View commit history (including long commit ID numbers)

    git log

 

revert — Revert all files back to a previous commit point

    git revert <long commit ID from the log command>

rm -cache

    Removes cache from a specific file so that it can be added to the .gitignore
